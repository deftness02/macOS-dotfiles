# macOS Dotfiles
The following are scripts relating to the rapid setup and configuration of macOS devices. I have taken the liberty to go into greater depth (and possibly modernize) dotfiles created by others. After being hacked and repeatedly having to wipe devices as various processes and applications were weaponized against me, it became apparent that manually setting up my computer each wipe was quite silly. So I found many examples of in-depth dotfiles from which I could base things according to my needs.

# Current State
As of the start of December 2022, this project is still in its early phases of work, so it is by no means complete or as comprehensive as I would like it.

# Who is Me
I am nobody. I am primarily a technical writer learning to code, so I will not make any far-reaching claims as to the extent of my abilities or the excellent-ness of work created, such as this. It is far from perfect and depends heavily on far more brilliant minds than mine to come up with the "how" for implementing this.

# Credit
I will not claim any amount of credit for coming up with this. It relied heavily on the previous work of others, which has served as a jumping point for me in creating a truly comprehensive configuration repo. A special thanks goes out to the following:
